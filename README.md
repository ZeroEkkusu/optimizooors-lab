# ðŸ§ª Optimizooor's Lab

**Welcome to the ðŸ§ª Optimizooor's Lab!**

Optimize code and run tests with our equipment for optimizooors:
- **[`MyLab`](#template-usage)**: An environment for running controlled experiments
- **[`GFlask`](#gflask-usage)**: An instrument for measuring gas savings with different optimizations

The lab runs natively in Solidity and is framework-agnostic.

## Findings

```text
Running 1 test for MyLab.json:MyLab
[PASS] test() (gas: 510664)
Logs:
  Increment `i += 1`
  
  Use `++i` instead
  SAVES (GAS): 3
  
  Try using `i = i + 1`
  No savings.
  
  Try using `i++`
  [!] More expensive (gas): -2
```

## Research

### [**â›³ Re:Golf Course**](https://github.com/ZeroEkkusu/re-golf-course)

A list of common Solidity optimization tips and myths.

## Instructions

Download `foundryup`

```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

Install Foundry

```bash
foundryup
```

Create a new project using our template

```bash
forge init --template https://github.com/ZeroEkkusu/optimizooors-lab my_lab
```

**Note:** Run `forge install` afterward to install `DSTest`.

... or install as a dependency

```bash
forge install https://github.com/ZeroEkkusu/optimizooors-lab
```

### Template usage

To use [`MyLab`](src/biohazard/MyLab.sol), provide code samples in [`Samples.sol`](src/Samples.sol):

```solidity
contract Sample0 is SharedSetup {
    function measureGas() external {
        uint i;
        i++;
    }
}

contract Sample1 is SharedSetup {
    function measureGas() external {
        uint i;
        ++i;
    }
}
```

**Note:** For more complex setups, use [`SharedSetup`](src/Samples.sol) to minimize boilerplate.

Run `forge test` to compare all provided samples against `Sample0`:

```console
00x@ubuntu:~$ forge test
SAVES (GAS): 5
```

It is possible to customize the console output with [`Labels`](src/Samples.sol):

```solidity
abstract contract Labels {
    string label0 = "Increment `i++`";
    string label1 = "Use `++i` instead";
    string label2 = "";
    string label3 = "";
    string label4 = "";
    string label5 = "";
}
```

Let's run `forge test` again:

```console
00x@ubuntu:~$ forge test
Increment `i++`

Use `++i` instead
SAVES (GAS): 5
```

**Note:** Combine with other commands at your disposal for more power. You can run `forge test --gas-report` to print the absolute gas costs as well.

> `Samples.sol` files are easy to share with others!
>
> Try copy-pasting their contents to another system and they'll work out of the box. No setup required.

### GFlask usage

To use [`GFlask`](src/biohazard/GFlask.sol) in your project, mark the function with unoptimized code as `unoptimized` and the ones with optimized code as `optimized`.

It is possible to customize the console output with labels. In the example below, we left them unlabeled (`""`).

Then, call all the functions inside one `test` function, first calling the `unoptimized` function:

```solidity
import "optimizooors-lab/biohazard/GFlask.sol"

contract Increment is GFlask {
    function iPlusPlus() public unoptimized("") {
        uint i;
        i++;
    }

    function plusPlusI() public optimized("") {
        uint i;
        ++i;
    }

    function testIncrement() {
        iPlusPlus();
        plusPlusI()
    }
}
```

After running `forge test`, you get the following output:

```console
00x@ubuntu:~$ forge test
SAVES (GAS): 5
```

**Note:** Combine with other commands at your disposal for more power. You can run `forge test --gas-report` to print the absolute gas costs as well.

Measuring gas savings can be tricky sometimes.

It is useful to have basic knowledge of how the optimizer works, so you can isolate the code properly.

E.g. If you stored `i` in storage instead of memory in the example above, the gas numbers would be incorrect!
